                <h2>About Mid-Century Modern</h2>
                <p>Mid-century modern design emerged in the post-World War II era as a response to both the optimism of the time and the need for practical, affordable design solutions. This movement was characterized by clean lines, minimal ornamentation, large windows, open floor plans, and an emphasis on bringing the outdoors inside.</p>
                
                <p>The movement was heavily influenced by the Bauhaus school and architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, whose organic architecture principles helped shape the aesthetic. Mid-century modern design wasn't just about buildingsâ€”it encompassed furniture, lighting, graphics, and everyday objects, creating a cohesive design philosophy that emphasized function, simplicity, and integration with nature.</p>

                <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clean Lines:</strong> Simple, straight lines with minimal curves or ornamentation</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Floor Plans:</strong> Flowing spaces that connected different areas of the home</li>
                    <li><strong>Large Windows:</strong> Expansive glass surfaces that brought natural light indoors</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Materials:</strong> Wood, stone, and metal used in their natural states</li>
                    <li><strong>Indoor-Outdoor Living:</strong> Seamless transitions between interior and exterior spaces</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Form follows function, with every element serving a purpose</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p>Mid-century modern design continues to influence contemporary architecture and design. Its emphasis on simplicity, functionality, and connection to nature resonates with today's sustainable design movements.
