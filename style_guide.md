# Design History Artifacts - Website Style Guide

## Design Philosophy
The website design will reflect the principles of mid-century modern design while maintaining contemporary usability standards. The aesthetic will honor Frank Lloyd Wright's organic architecture principles and the clean lines of mid-century modern design, creating a harmonious backdrop for the artifacts without competing with them.

## Layout Principles

### Grid System
- 12-column responsive grid
- Generous whitespace between elements
- Asymmetrical balance inspired by mid-century modern compositions
- Golden ratio proportions where appropriate

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear heading structure with significant size contrast
- Important artifacts and information positioned in the upper left quadrant
- Use of whitespace to create focus on artifact images
- Consistent vertical rhythm throughout the pages

## UI Elements

### Navigation
- Horizontal main navigation with dropdown menus
- Sticky header that minimizes on scroll
- Clear indication of current section
- Breadcrumb navigation on artifact detail pages

### Buttons
- Rectangular with slight rounding (2px radius)
- Minimal styling with hover effects
- Primary buttons in terracotta red
- Secondary buttons with outline style

### Cards
- Clean, minimal design with subtle shadows
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Hover effects that slightly elevate the card
- Featured artifacts with larger cards and more prominent imagery

### Image Treatments
- High-quality, well-lit artifact photography
- Consistent aspect ratios where possible
- Subtle drop shadows to create depth for artifact images
- Ability to zoom in on artifact details
- Gallery view with thumbnails for multiple images

## Interactive Elements

### Hover States
- Subtle color shifts for links and buttons
- Slight scaling or elevation for cards and clickable elements
- Transition duration: 0.2-0.3 seconds for smooth but responsive feel

### Transitions
- Page transitions with gentle fades
- Content loading with subtle animations
- Smooth scrolling behavior

### Special Features
- Timeline component for historical context
- Before/after comparison for sketch-to-product views of the lamp designs
- Zoomable high-resolution images of book pages and signatures
- Interactive 3D viewer for Froebel blocks (if budget allows)

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 767px
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px - 1439px
- Large Desktop: 1440px and above

### Mobile Considerations
- Single column layout on smallest screens
- Collapsible navigation menu
- Larger touch targets for interactive elements
- Optimized image loading for mobile connections

## Accessibility

### Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Proper heading structure
- Adequate color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Alt text for all images
- Keyboard navigable interface

### Inclusive Design
- Text resizing without breaking layout
- Support for screen readers
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Reduced motion option for animations

## Design Motifs

### Geometric Patterns
- Subtle background patterns inspired by Wright's geometric designs
- Grid-based layouts reflecting Froebel block influence
- Angular elements echoing mid-century modern furniture design

### Iconography
- Custom icons with consistent stroke weight
- Geometric, minimal style
- Clear meaning without text when possible
- Size: 24px Ã— 24px standard, scaling appropriately for different contexts
