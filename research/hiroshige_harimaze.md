## Frank Lloyd Wright Connection
This print has a remarkable connection to Frank Lloyd Wright:

- Wright was an avid collector of Japanese woodblock prints
- In 1913, while visiting Japan, Wright purchased an almost complete set of original woodblocks for Hiroshige's "Harimaze Pictures of Famous Places in Edo"
- In 1991, scholar Roger Keyes rediscovered these blocks in the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives
- The Frank Lloyd Wright Archives worked with the Adachi Institute of Woodblock Prints to produce a re-issue of the harimaze series from Wright's original blocks
- Limited edition of 220 sets, each containing 10 woodblock prints
- Each print features the embossed seal of Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West in the lower left corner

## About Harimaze Prints

## Frank Lloyd Wright's Relationship with Japanese Art

### Wright as Collector and Dealer
- Wright was an admirer, early and significant collector, and active dealer of Japanese prints throughout his career
- He sold hundreds of prints to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
- Wright wrote "The Japanese Print: An Interpretation" (1912), one of his most lucid theoretical writings
- In this work, he describes how master artists used observations of nature and culture to create objects of great beauty

### Influence on Wright's Design Philosophy
Wright was inspired by several key aspects of Japanese prints:

1. **Simplicity and Directness** - The straightforward approach to depicting subjects
2. **Abstractions of Natural Form and Structure** - How artists reduced complex natural forms to their essential elements
3. **"Elimination of the Insignificant"** - The process of removing unnecessary details to focus on the essential
4. **Organic Integrity** - The fundamental law of beauty within the work of art itself
5. **Geometric Structure** - The underlying mathematical principles that create "spell-power" in geometric forms

### Key Quotes from Wright on Japanese Prints
- "The Japanese print is a quickening inspiration owing to its essentially structural character and diverse materials and methods"
- Wright described how Japanese artists could "tell you what he knows in a single drawing, but never will he attempt to tell you all he knows"
- He praised their "process of simplification" as "a dramatization of the subject"

### Connection to Organic Architecture
Wright saw Japanese prints as embodying the same principles he sought in his "organic architecture":
- Harmony between human creation and the natural world
- Structural integrity as the foundation of beauty
- Simplification without losing essential meaning
- Integration of geometric principles with natural forms

### The 1913 Japan Trip and Hiroshige Collection
- Wright purchased the original woodblocks for Hiroshige's "Harimaze Pictures of Famous Places in Edo" during his 1913 visit to Japan
- These blocks were rediscovered in the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives in 1991 by scholar Roger Keyes
- The Frank Lloyd Wright Archives collaborated with the Adachi Institute of Woodblock Prints to create a limited re-issue
- Only 220 sets were produced, each containing 10 woodblock prints
- Each print bears the embossed seal of Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West


## About Harimaze Prints

### Definition and Format
**Harimaze-e** (張交絵): "Mixed pasted prints" - a print with multiple images on the same sheet. Each picture was meant to be cut out from the original sheet. In some examples, more than one artist designed the various images on a single sheet.

### Historical Context
- Harimaze prints were popular during the Edo period (17th to 19th centuries) in Japan
- They provided a cost-effective way for artists and publishers to recycle and present multiple designs
- The format allowed for efficient use of paper and printing resources
- Collectors could cut apart the individual scenes and paste them into albums or apply them to screens

### Artistic Significance
- Harimaze prints often featured famous places (meisho) in Edo (modern Tokyo)
- They served as both artistic works and practical souvenirs
- The format allowed artists to showcase multiple compositions and techniques on a single sheet
- They were accessible to a broader audience due to their cost-effectiveness

### Connection to Frank Lloyd Wright's Collection
The specific harimaze series "Pictures of Famous Places in Edo" that Wright collected represents:
- A direct link between Japanese artistic tradition and American modernist design
- Wright's appreciation for Japanese principles of simplification and geometric structure
- The influence of Japanese spatial concepts on Wright's architectural philosophy
- A tangible connection between Eastern and Western design aesthetics

### Significance in Design History
This Hiroshige harimaze print serves as a bridge between:
- Traditional Japanese ukiyo-e art and modern Western design
- Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural philosophy and Japanese aesthetic principles
- Historical collecting practices and contemporary appreciation of Japanese art
- The global influence of Japanese design on 20th-century modernism

## Why This Print Belongs in the Collection
This Hiroshige harimaze print is not just a beautiful example of Japanese art - it's a direct link to Frank Lloyd Wright's personal collection and aesthetic development. The fact that Wright himself owned the original woodblocks for this very series makes it an essential piece for understanding the cross-cultural influences that shaped modern design. It demonstrates how Japanese principles of simplification, natural harmony, and geometric structure directly influenced Wright's organic architecture philosophy, making it a perfect complement to the other Wright-related artifacts in the collection.
